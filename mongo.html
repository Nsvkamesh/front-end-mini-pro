        <h3>What is MongoDB?</h3>
        MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model. It is designed to store, query, and process large volumes of data efficiently. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas.

        <h3>Key Features of MongoDB:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Schema-less: No predefined schema required, allows flexibility.</li>
            <li>Document-oriented: Stores data in JSON-like format (BSON).</li>
            <li>Scalable: Supports horizontal scaling through sharding.</li>
            <li>High Performance: Optimized for read and write operations.</li>
            <li>Indexing: Supports various types of indexing to improve query performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Basic Concepts in MongoDB:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Database: A container for collections.</li>
            <li>Collection: A group of MongoDB documents, equivalent to a table in relational databases.</li>
            <li>Document: A set of key-value pairs, equivalent to a row in relational databases.</li>
            <li>Index: Improves the speed of query operations.</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>INTERVIEW Q&A</h1>
    <h2>MongoDB Interview Questions</h2>
    <div class="question">What is MongoDB?</div>
    <div>Answer: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents and is designed for scalability and high performance.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases.</div>
    <div>Answer: SQL databases use a structured query language and have a predefined schema, while NoSQL databases, like MongoDB, use dynamic schemas for unstructured data and do not require a fixed schema.</div>
    
    <div class="question">What are the advantages of using MongoDB?</div>
    <div>Answer: MongoDB provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. It allows for flexible data modeling, indexing, and powerful querying.</div>
    
    <div class="question">How do you create a database in MongoDB?</div>
    <div>Answer: A database is created in MongoDB when you first store data in it. For example, using the command `use database_name` in the MongoDB shell creates a database if it does not already exist.</div>
    
    <div class="question">What is a MongoDB collection?</div>
    <div>Answer: A collection in MongoDB is a group of documents. It is equivalent to a table in relational databases but does not enforce a schema.</div>
    
    <div class="question">How do you insert a document into a MongoDB collection?</div>
    <div>Answer: You can insert a document into a MongoDB collection using the insertOne() or insertMany() methods. For example, `db.collection.insertOne({ name: "John", age: 30 })`.</div>
    
    <div class="question">What is an index in MongoDB?</div>
    <div>Answer: An index in MongoDB is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a collection. Indexes are created using the createIndex() method.</div>
    
    <div class="question">What is sharding in MongoDB?</div>
    <div>Answer: Sharding in MongoDB is a method for distributing data across multiple servers to support horizontal scaling. It helps in handling large datasets and high throughput operations.</div>
    
    <div class="question">How does replication work in MongoDB?</div>
    <div>Answer: Replication in MongoDB involves creating multiple copies of data across different servers. This is done using replica sets, which ensure data redundancy and increase data availability.</div>
    
    <div class="question">What is the Aggregation Framework in MongoDB?</div>
    <div>Answer: The Aggregation Framework in MongoDB is used to process data records and return computed results. It allows for complex data transformations and aggregations using a pipeline approach.</div>

    <h2>Advanced MongoDB Questions</h2>
    <div class="question">What is the difference between embedded and referenced documents in MongoDB?</div>
    <div>Answer: Embedded documents store related data within a single document, which can improve read performance. Referenced documents store related data in separate documents, which can be more flexible but may require additional queries.</div>

    <div class="question">Explain the concept of a MongoDB replica set.</div>
    <div>Answer: A MongoDB replica set is a group of MongoDB instances that maintain the same data set. Replica sets provide redundancy and high availability by automatically failing over to a secondary node if the primary node fails.</div>

    <div class="question">What is the purpose of the $lookup operation in MongoDB?</div>
    <div>Answer: The $lookup operation in MongoDB performs a left outer join to retrieve related documents from a different collection. It is used within the Aggregation Framework to combine data from multiple collections.</div>

    <div class="question">How do you handle schema migrations in MongoDB?</div>
    <div>Answer: Schema migrations in MongoDB can be handled using scripts or tools like MongoDB's built-in `mongodump` and `mongorestore` utilities, or by using a schema migration library to apply changes incrementally.</div>

    <div class="question">What is the purpose of the MongoDB Atlas?</div>
    <div>Answer: MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud database service provided by MongoDB. It automates deployment, scaling, and management of MongoDB databases, and provides additional features like backups, monitoring, and security.</div>
