        <h3>What are Data Structures?</h3>
        Data structures are ways to organize and store data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They are fundamental to designing efficient algorithms and managing data.

        <h3>Key Types of Data Structures:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Arrays</li>
            <li>Linked Lists</li>
            <li>Stacks</li>
            <li>Queues</li>
            <li>Trees</li>
            <li>Graphs</li>
            <li>Hash Tables</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Importance of Data Structures:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Efficiency: Improves the efficiency of data manipulation and retrieval.</li>
            <li>Reusability: Helps in reusing code and improving maintainability.</li>
            <li>Performance: Critical for optimizing the performance of software applications.</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>INTERVIEW Q&A</h1>
    <h2>Data Structures Interview Questions</h2>
    <div class="question">What is an array?</div>
    <div>Answer: An array is a collection of elements, each identified by an array index. Arrays store elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations.</div>
    
    <div class="question">Explain the difference between a linked list and an array.</div>
    <div>Answer: Arrays have fixed size and allow random access, while linked lists are dynamic in size and elements are linked using pointers, allowing efficient insertions and deletions.</div>
    
    <div class="question">What is a stack?</div>
    <div>Answer: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Operations include push (insert), pop (remove), and peek (retrieve top element).</div>
    
    <div class="question">What is a queue?</div>
    <div>Answer: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Operations include enqueue (insert), dequeue (remove), and front (retrieve front element).</div>
    
    <div class="question">What is a binary tree?</div>
    <div>Answer: A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.</div>
    
    <div class="question">What is a graph?</div>
    <div>Answer: A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes. Graphs can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted.</div>
    
    <div class="question">What is a hash table?</div>
    <div>Answer: A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values for efficient data retrieval. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets where the desired value can be found.</div>
    
    <div class="question">What is a linked list?</div>
    <div>Answer: A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains a data part and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence.</div>
    
    <div class="question">What is a doubly linked list?</div>
    <div>Answer: A doubly linked list is a type of linked list where each node contains a reference to both the next and the previous node, allowing traversal in both directions.</div>
    
    <div class="question">What is a tree traversal?</div>
    <div>Answer: Tree traversal is the process of visiting all the nodes in a tree data structure in a specific order. Common methods include in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal.</div>

    <h2>Advanced Data Structures Questions</h2>
    <div class="question">What is a balanced tree?</div>
    <div>Answer: A balanced tree is a type of binary tree where the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is not more than one, ensuring O(log n) height.</div>

    <div class="question">Explain the difference between BFS and DFS.</div>
    <div>Answer: BFS (Breadth-First Search) explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, while DFS (Depth-First Search) explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.</div>

    <div class="question">What is a priority queue?</div>
    <div>Answer: A priority queue is an abstract data type similar to a regular queue, but each element has a priority. Elements with higher priority are dequeued before elements with lower priority.</div>

    <div class="question">What is a trie?</div>
    <div>Answer: A trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a type of search tree used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. It supports efficient string search operations.</div>

    <div class="question">Explain the concept of dynamic programming.</div>
    <div>Answer: Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It involves storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.</div>
